# Cross Language Validation ECMAScript 6
This JavaScript implements the client side part of the [Cross Language Validation Schema](https://github.com/stephan-double-u/cross-language-validation-schema)
i.e. it:
- is able to consume JSON instances of that schema
- provides an API to validate the validation rules defined in that instances against the relevant objects

# TODO
- TBD
